					People often get confused when it comes to understanding the stock market and investing, and consider it as a gambling market. But little do they know that the stock market, if understood & used correctly, can do wonders with your money!
					Here's a clear guide to help you find the perfect path to begin your investing journey, so that you can make the most out of the market.

				<p class="fs125 lh2 mt1">Let's start by answering these simple questions:</p>
				<p class="fs15 fw700 lh2 mt05 mb2">
					Who should drink water? Who should eat food? Who should exercise?
				</p>
				<p class="fs1125 lh2 mb2">
					<strong>That's right. Everyone.</strong><br />
					Just like drinking water, eating food & staying fit are life's basic necessities, earning & growing money is also equally important. Everyone wants to increase their net worth, and wants to provide their family with a good life. And simply living from paycheck to paycheck is hardly going to suffice that. Hence, not investing is not an option.
					Just like you have to drink water to live, you have to invest to grow your money. Irrespective of your age and monthly income, the right investing will always bear full results and fruitful returns. So yes, anyone & everyone should invest.

					The sooner you start the better it is.
				</p>
				<p class="fs1125 lh2 mb2">
					Going back to what we started with, there is no right time to start drinking water, or eating food or exercise. You just do it whenever you feel thirsty, hungry or lazy. Similarly, there is no right time to start investing. Anyone can start investing at any age they want. The only thing that will differ will be the type of investment and its allocation, based on your income, savings and spendings and of course, your financial goals.
					A 12 year old will have different financial goals and risk taking capacity as compared to a 42 year old. So, your age will impact your investing style and not the <strong>when</strong> of when you should start investing.

					So, the first and foremost step to start investing is to learn its basic concepts so that you can understand how the market works and make well-informed decisions.
					But, the lengthy & boring financial courses that are available in the market make this process dull. Here's where Finology Quest comes to your rescue!  Learn investing & finance on the go with Quest's action-packed, practical courses which are adjustable to your attention span.

					<strong>Of course not! Then how can you expect this with investing?</strong> Investing requires practice, so the next step after learning concepts is to align what you've learnt with the real world. Before actually investing, witness the market in action and analyse a few stocks with the right information & data.
					Unfortunately, that's what's missing from today's equity research tools, where the data is often inaccurate. Finology Ticker is specially designed to solve this problem by providing a vast data bank of all the listed companies. The best part? Ticker is completely technology-backed so that you can make accurate analyses and choose only the best stocks.

					<strong>You still don't know how much risk you can take and how much money you should invest for your goals. For this, you need a suitable portfolio mix for yourself.</strong>
					But modern-day consultants skip the essentials and only focus on recommending instruments that earn them a commission. Most often, at the cost of the investor's risk-taking capacity. 
					Finology Recipe brings an end to this by introducing a DIY platform, that gives you the power to self-manage your money according to your goals and risk profile.
					It enables you to create a systematic financial plan by yourself assisted by smart tools and insights. 
					You can check your financial health, create goals and get stock recommendations for the long term, all in one place. Our objective is to help you grow your wealth, and not just your income.
